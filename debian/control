Description: hector_object_tracker is the core package of hector_worldmodel. It listens to percept message from detectors (e.g. heat signatures of persons or recognitions of other objects of interest in the scene) and fuses all information to a single worldmodel state. Objects will be tracked over time and their states can be influenced by a couple of services. The percept to object association problem is solved either automatically based on the Mahalanobis distance, or a unique object_id can be given in the percept message. If a hector_nav_msgs/GetDistanceToObstacle service is available, the object_tracker can optionally deduce the depth of objects in the scene by projection to the nearest obstacle (wall).
